of the ancient Avanti mahajanapada, whose capital Ujjain (also known as Avanti)
arose as a major city during the second wave of Indian urbanisation in the sixth
century BCE. <br>Subsequently, the region was ruled by the major dynasties of
India, including the Mauryans, Satvahanas, Rashtrakutas, the Mughals and the
Marathas. By the early 18th century, the region was divided into several small
kingdoms which were captured by the British and incorporated into Central
Provinces and Berar and the Central India Agency. <br> In 1956, this state was
reorganised and its parts were combined with the states of Madhya Bharat,
Vindhya Pradesh and Bhopal to form the new Madhya Pradesh state with Bhopal
as its capital; the Marathi-speaking Vidarbha region was removed and merged
with the then Bombay State. This state was the largest in India by area until 2000,
when its southeastern Chhattisgarh regionwas made a separate state.</p>
